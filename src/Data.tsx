                    "Sybille Raphael's approach to this theme evolved around whistleblowing in the digital age. Why do bad things remain hidden for so long? In the UK it took 20 years to unravel the tragic miscarriage of justice that saw hundreds of innocent local Postmasters convicted because a faulty accounting software made them look as if they had been stealing money.  What does it take to reveal the rot concealed within an organisation? Why is it so difficult to speakup? Does technology help or does it make it harder? What’s the hidden cost for individuals, for business, for society? And what can we do to solve this?  The retaliatory model or the incentive model?  What's our own individual agency in all this?
